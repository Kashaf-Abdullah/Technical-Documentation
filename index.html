                C++ is a general purpose programming
                language and widely used now a days '
                for competitive programming. It has
                imperative, object-oriented and generic
                programming features. C++ runs on lots of
                platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.
                C++ is an efficient
                and powerful language and finds wide use
                in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and
                real-time simulations. Because of the
                inclusion of rich function libraries,
                working in C++ becomes simpler and
                convenient than C. Being object-oriented
                programming like Java, C++ provides
                the support of inheritance, polymorphism,
                encapsulation, etc. Unlike C, C++ allows
                exception handling and function overloading.

            <p>he “Hello World” program is the first

                C++ is a general purpose programming
                language and widely used now a days '
                for competitive programming. It has
                imperative, object-oriented and generic
                programming features. C++ runs on lots of
                platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.
                C++ is an efficient
                and powerful language and finds wide use
                in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and
                real-time simulations. Because of the
                inclusion of rich function libraries,
                working in C++ becomes simpler and
                convenient than C. Being object-oriented
                programming like Java, C++ provides
                the support of inheritance, polymorphism,
                encapsulation, etc. Unlike C, C++ allows
                exception handling and function overloading.

                C++ is a general purpose programming
                language and widely used now a days '
                for competitive programming. It has
                imperative, object-oriented and generic
                programming features. C++ runs on lots of
                platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.
                C++ is an efficient
                and powerful language and finds wide use
                in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and
                real-time simulations. Because of the
                inclusion of rich function libraries,
                working in C++ becomes simpler and
                convenient than C. Being object-oriented
                programming like Java, C++ provides
                the support of inheritance, polymorphism,
                encapsulation, etc. Unlike C, C++ allows
                exception handling and function overloading.

            <p>he “Hello World” program is the first
